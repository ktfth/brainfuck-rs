# Brainfuck Interpreter

## Description

Yet another [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter as part of a
train, early on my career I was fascinated by the fact of create other pieces of technology as
programming language with my knowledge and learn with my failures is the best parte in my
humble option.

So I have created this project to put in practice and I need your help to write valid program
to put the interpreter on fire proof.

## Usage

Clone the project on your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/ktfth/brainfuck-rs
```

After that you can continue with the installation of rust(optional if present):

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Or just visiting the `https://rustup.rs` to see other instructions. With this in mind
you can follow the next steps as run to see the project in action.

```
cargo run -- input.bf
```

Note: The file can be whatever you need.

You eve gonna see the output with a simple `Hello World!` and yay, you made it.
